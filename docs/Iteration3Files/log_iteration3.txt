Mark’s Log

Task: implement iterators to days
Completed July 31
Time Assigned: 1 Hour
Time took: 1 hour
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/139
Notes: Days now return an iterator over it’s lists rather than returning the whole list.
 
Task: Fixing database label propagation issues
Completed August 1
Time Assigned: 2 Hour
Time took: 3 hours, 
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/140
Notes: Modifying/deleting labels now affects corresponding label goals. 
 
Task: Retrospective Write Up
Completed: August 2
Time took: 2 hours

Notes:
 
Task: Integration Testing
Completed: August 2, August 7
Time Assigned: 2 Hour
Time took: 2 hours, 1 hour (hotfix)
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/159
Notes: (Aug 2) Completed Initial pass of integration tests. (Aug 7) Went back and added handling errors as expected. 
 
 
Task: Allow users to set default values for a new day
Completed August 3
Time Assigned: 3 Hour

Time took: 3.5 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/142
Notes: User’s can now click save as default for a day. This will be the new default when a user goes to a new day.  A user can reset the default to an empty day by clicking the reset default button.  It is implemented by having each account have a day they have tracked with a special id.  This id is 0 so no day of the year will replace it.  This allowed us to reuse the already existing infrastructure in the persistence and business layer to easily implement this.  We save this day to the account as day 0 and any time we go to a new day we just copy the day values over.  
 
Task: Refactor Data Access Interface
Completed August 3
Time Assigned: 2 Hour
Time took: 3 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/164
Notes: Refactored the persistence layer function names and business layer method names.  Access account has two aspects to it: user info and days that are tracked.  To modify days has the expected methods such as updateDay or addDay.  However for user info we had misleading names such as updateAccount which really only updated the user info.  Furthermore many of these methods took an account parameter when all was used was the user info in account.  Now they only take the user info as a parameter if we only use the data of user info in the account.  These changes then were modified when they were called so all tests passed.  This took longer than expected as there were lots of places that called this code that needed to be updated.
 
Task: Refactor Showing Front End Errors For Duplicate Foods
Completed: August 9
Time Assigned: 1 Hour

Task: Show Errors When Users Make Invalid Goals
Completed: August 9
Time Assigned: 1 Hour
Time took: 2 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/183
Notes: Show errors on front end when user inputs invalid data for making goals
 
Task:  Fix Error Where Proper Quantity of Food is not Added To The Day
Completed: August 9
Time Assigned: 1 Hour
Time took: 2 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/192
Notes: Turned out to be a backend issue.  When we update the day we always set all the food in the day to have 1 quantity in the database. Short Pr but took a long time to track down the bug

Task:  Create Label Activity
Completed: August 10
Time Assigned: 2 Hour
Time took: 2.5 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/195  
Notes: This shows all the labels in the app.  You can add/remove/update any label you choose.
 
 
Task:  Fix Error Squelching
Completed: August 11
Time Assigned: 1 Hour
Time took: 1.5 Hour
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/198  
Notes: Especially in access classes often if we try to add a duplicate we simply return from the function and not add it.  Also if we tried to remove an item that didn’t exist we would get an error.  This is somewhat backwards as removing an item that doesn’t exist is not a problem as remove is idempotent but adding a duplicate definitely is not so in that case we now throw an error. Also adjusted ui to also handle this accordingly.
 
 Task:  Allow User to Remove Edibles
Completed: August 12

Time Assigned: 1 Hour
Time took: 1 hours
Linked Issue: https://github.com/COMP3350-Group5/meal-buddy/issues/211
Notes: Refactored Calculator business class and fixed an error in the calculator where it didn’t account for the quantity of a edible properly because we were calling a depreciated method from previous iteration before edibles were turned into composite objects.
